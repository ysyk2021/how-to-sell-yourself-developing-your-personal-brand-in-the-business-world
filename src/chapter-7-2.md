* **Facebook:** Useful for building a community and sharing longer-form content such as articles, videos, and events.

* **YouTube:** Ideal for video content, tutorials, and showcasing your expertise through webinars or vlogs.

Craft Engaging Content

The content you share on social media plays a pivotal role in building your personal brand. Here are strategies to create engaging content:

* **Educational Content:** Share valuable insights, industry knowledge, and how-to guides to establish yourself as an authority in your niche.
